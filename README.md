- 👋 Hi, I’m @antonmorch
- 👀 I’m interested in automation and the ways of the IoT. I've been dabbling in Raspberry Pi and arduino to make some home irrigation systems, but I've yet to come up with my own stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Git. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. Just lurking and learning. 
- 📫 How to reach me antonm93@gmail.com
